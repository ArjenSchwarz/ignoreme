&lt;p&gt;[T]he techniques described in this section are generic enough and also work for reversing other frozen Python applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that lately every week there is some new security measure is broken. While part of the actual research shows that security through obscurity in the end never seems to work, I am not happy to see that they managed to bypass the two-factor authentication. In defence of Dropbox though, their security keeps improving with every version.&lt;/p&gt;
