I gave a short lightning talk about automating the creation of AWS API Gateways at the AWS Meetup. This is based on the work I did for that on Igor.

This same presentation was also given at the Serverless Meetup in Melbourne on April 20, 2016.

A more in-depth article I wrote concerning this script can be found in my [Setting up Lambda and a gateway through the CLI article](/2016/03/setting-up-lambda-and-a-gateway-through-the-cli/).

The script mentioned can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/igor/tree/master/installation).

At the Serverless Meetup I also mentioned [Aqua](/2016/04/aqua-easy-api-gateway-creation/), a more general application that I built for automating gateway creation. The GitHub repository for Aqua is [here](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/aqua)

I'm writing various articles about other details of Igor as well, and you can find those on [Igor's project page](/projects/igor).
