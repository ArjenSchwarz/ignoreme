A more in-depth article I wrote concerning this script can be found in my [Setting up Lambda and a gateway through the CLI article](/2016/03/setting-up-lambda-and-a-gateway-through-the-cli/).

The script mentioned can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/igor/tree/master/installation).

I'm writing various articles about other details of Igor as well, and you can find those on [Igor's project page](/projects/igor).
