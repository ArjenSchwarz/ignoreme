As part of the Community Builders program that [I joined recently](/2023/02/aws-community-builder/), the APJ (Asia-Pacific + Japan) region recently started a monthly Open Mic night. These were already happening semi-regularly but have now become a monthly thing. So I figured I'd throw my hat in the ring to speak at the first one and my talk was selected. In this talk I'm giving a demo of [fog](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/fog)'s automated deployment report functionality. It's not the best talk I've given, but it was still fun and hopefully it's interesting. The intro for the talk starts about 90 seconds in if you don't want to sit through the explanation of the Open Mic. Also, there's a couple of interesting talks following it so stay no need to stop after my talk has finished.
