Wow, I just discovered this post never got published, so about 2 years late, but still potentially relevant I'm posting now about the talk I gave at the Golang Melbourne meetup **2 years ago**. This talk is about my [go-output module](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/go-output), which is the module I wrote to ensure the output formatting and methods between my various tools are the same. More background is in the talk, and the recording has now gone live. Also, as a bonus, I briefly explain [Presso-Driven Development](/2023/05/presso-driven-development/).

My talk is the second one on the video but the embedded video uses a timestamp to get you straight there. However, if you're interested in Go[^whyelse] and particularly in mocking your tests, I recommend watching the preceding talk by my DigIO colleague Mirjam Uher.

[^whyelse]: If you're not interested, my talk might not be of great interest to you either.
