Description:  "An introductory talk to DeepRacer"
---

At the AWS User Group in Melbourne, which I help run, we recently got a DeepRacer track that we let our attendees use to test their models before the evening's talks kick off. In order to introduce people to what is basically a small self-driving car, I gave a talk to show what DeepRacer is and how you can train your models for it. 

If you prefer a written version, my [original write-up after re:Invent](/2018/12/deepracer/) is still valid. Otherwise, have a look at the below video.
