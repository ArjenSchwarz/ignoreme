After a very long delay, our September episode finally drops. Recorded in early October Arjen, JM, and Guy discuss how September finally has a fair number of interesting announcements again and of course point out everything that wasn't great as well.

I got quite a bit behind on editing this podcast, but I mostly caught up during the Christmas break so over the next 2 weeks the remaining episodes will be aired as well.

You can find the full shownotes and links at [the episode page](https://podcast.awsug.org.au/e/what-s-new-in-september-2021).
