Pull your podcast player out of instant retrieval, because we're discussing re:Invent 2021 as well as the weeks before it. Lots of announcements; big, small, weird, awesome, and anything in between. We had fun with this episode and hope you do too.

This episode actually marks the end of the backlog that I needed to edit, and I'm happy to see it up there. That means I don't need to worry about editing another episode until we record the next one. Which will be tomorrow...
