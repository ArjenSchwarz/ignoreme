summary: "In this month's episode Arjen, JM, and Guy discuss the news from January 2022. Well, everything announced after re:Invent really, but that's mostly from January. There are good announcements all over; from a new Console Home to unpronounceable instance types, but there is also some news around the podcast that's either good or bad depending on how you interpret it."

In this month's episode Arjen, JM, and Guy discuss the news from January 2022. Well, everything announced after re:Invent really, but that's mostly from January. There are good announcements all over; from a new Console Home to unpronounceable instance types, but there is also some news around the podcast that's either good or bad depending on how you interpret it.

This one is a bit bittersweet as Guy will soon be joining AWS which means that he can't be on the podcast anymore. Also, there is mention of a blogpost I want to write in the episode. I am actually writing that and it will go within the next week.

You can find the full shownotes and links at [the episode page](https://podcast.awsug.org.au/e/what-s-new-in-january-2022/).
