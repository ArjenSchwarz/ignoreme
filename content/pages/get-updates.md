In case you want to know when I post new articles it's unlikely that you will want to check the site manually every day. To make it easier for you, there are several ways in which you can receive updates about new content being posted to this site.

## RSS

If you use an RSS reader, there are feeds available. Either a [traditional RSS feed](/index.xml) or a [JSON Feed](/feed.json) which you should only use if you know your reader supports it and I mostly built to try things out.

## Mastodon

If you're on Mastodon, the feed will automatically be posted to [@ig.nore.me/@feed](https://mastodon.ig.nore.me/@feed).

## LinkedIn

Similarly, the feed will automatically post to the [LinkedIn page as well](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ig-nore-me).

## Twitter

Unfortunately Twitter has removed the option to automatically post to an account (for free) and also blocked the bot user I had for it. As I don't use my personal account there anymore either, that means it's no longer a valid way of receiving updates.

## Email

If you prefer to be notified by email instead, filling in the below form will do so. Your email address will only be used to send you site content, and you can unsubscribe at any time.

<div id="mc_embed_signup">
<h2>Keep up to date!</h2>
<p>Subscribe to get the latest content by email.</p>
<form action="//nore.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=3fad9dbf9fc9fd9864691d976&amp;id=8fad3fb827" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank" novalidate>
<div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll">

<input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="email" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="email address" required>
<!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups-->
<div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_3fad9dbf9fc9fd9864691d976_8fad3fb827" tabindex="-1" value=""></div>
<div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button"></div>
</div>
</form>
</div>
