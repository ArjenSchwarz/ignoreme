Title: Behind Mo-Lebrity @ Bulletproof
date: 2017-11-28T14:35:04+11:00
summary: "Together with some of my colleagues we built a small side project to support the Movember charity. On the Bulletproof blog I've written a high-level overview of what this entailed. It was an interesting experience, where I got to play with a number of things for the first time and rekindled my 'love' for Javascript."

This quickly turned into a brainstorming session that resulted in a number of ideas, where we eventually settled on [Mo-lebrity](https://www.molebrity.io/): a site where someone can take a photo of themselves and see which moustache-wearing celebrity they look the most like.
