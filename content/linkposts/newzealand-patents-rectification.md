> At best, one can read between the lines of that bill that there was some pressure to be restrictive in connection with software patents</p>

It seems like I might have been celebrating too early with my link yesterday. According to this article there is far too much wriggle room left, so that it's pretty easy to get software patented after all. Unfortunately, for some strange reason laws are written in a way that you need to be an expert to understand them; and I'm not.

Which means I can't say for certain if this article is correct, but it seems likely. Now, if only the NSA hadn't caused Groklaw to [shut down](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130818120421175) it might have been dissected and explained there.
