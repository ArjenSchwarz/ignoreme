>Developers everywhere - PHP is not the same as it was even two years ago. Stop acting like it.

As someone who has had to deal with applications in Drupal, Magento, and similar frameworks I can only agree with Jarrod's statements here. While those are indeed a good reason to look at PHP as something horrible, the way PHP has grown is spectacular. In fact, I believe that it the tools in the community have improved so much that it is probably quicker and faster right now to start a new project while pulling in useful tools with Composer than try to fix an existing codebase.
