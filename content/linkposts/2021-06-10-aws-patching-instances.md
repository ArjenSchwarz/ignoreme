summary: "When it comes to computers in any form there is one task that it’s hard to find anyone who enjoys it, and that is patching. While updating a system in order to get new capabilities can be fun because of what it will enable you to do, patching means spending time to maintain the status quo. Which is both boring and frustrating. Luckily cloud infrastructure allows us to more easily automate this, so let’s have a look at how that works when running on AWS. This post is on the CMD blog as part of a series."

Over on the CMD blog, I wrote about how to make it easy to patch your EC2 instances in an automated manner. If you're interested, you [should read it](https://www.cmdsolutions.com.au/aws-and-patching-easily-keep-your-instances-up-to-date/).

CMD Solutions is the AWS focused brand within Mantel Group, which DigIO (my employer) is also a part of. Because of my status as AWS APN Ambassador, I represent CMD as well. Which also means that for some of my blogposts[^1], those focused on some small part of AWS for example, CMD is the better outlet. This is a good example of that.

[^1]: At least those that I write as a representive of my company. Obviously, the best place for anything I write is right here ;).
