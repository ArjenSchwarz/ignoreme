> In this overview of the Hardening your AWS Environment talk we gave at the AWS User Group in Melbourne we're focusing on the monitoring and infrastructure access aspects discussed there.

In case you found the writeup of my [last presentation](/presentations/2017/09/hardening-your-aws-environment/) a bit long, I posted a shorter version on the [Bulletproof blog](https://www.bulletproof.net.au/hardening-aws-environment/). It doesn't have everything from the original writeup, but still contains some useful advice.
