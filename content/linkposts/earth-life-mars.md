>Itâ€™s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to Earth on a Martian meteorite, rather than starting on this planet.

While I have my doubts this is close to conclusive proof, the idea of life starting elsewhere isn't exactly new. And to me personally it's always been a fascinating theory, as it makes it more likely for there to be life on other planets as well.
