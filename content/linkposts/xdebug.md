>Now lastly, have you ever wished to be able to step through your code, line by line, watch expressions, and even step into a function call to see why it’s producing the wrong return value?

While I don't agree with running your development server on your Mac instead of using a Vagrant box, this is  still a pretty good introduction into a very important debugging tool. Having Xdebug set up correctly can save you a lot of time and headaches, and is an actual good reason for using an IDE.   
Of course, after the debugging you can continue as normal in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), or [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).
