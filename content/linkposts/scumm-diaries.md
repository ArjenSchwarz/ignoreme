>The version of SCUMM that was used for Maniac probably shared 80 percent or more of the commands used in later games such as Full Throttle.

A great in-depth breakdown of one of the best classical tools for making games. I've enjoyed playing many of the games running on SCUMM and aside from the technical details, this article also shows the fun the developers must have had while building it. Definitely worth a read.
