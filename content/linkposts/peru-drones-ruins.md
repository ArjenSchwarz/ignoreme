>Small drones have been helping a growing number of researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps â€“ and in days and weeks instead of months and years.

As a child I always wanted to become an archaeologist, and on that basis alone this kind of thing is just great. Using drones like this shows how useful they can actually be when they are used for a good purpose. And as the prices keep going down it's a matter of time before we see more and more uses these drones can be applied to.

Of course, we shouldn't forget about the other side of the coin of [Droney](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/28/1094024/-Droney).
