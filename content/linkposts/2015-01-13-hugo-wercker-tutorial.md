> In this tutorial we will set up a basic Hugo project and then configure a free tool called Wercker to automatically deploy the generated site any time we add an article.

At the start of the year I mentioned writing a step for [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com) to help with automating deployments for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) sites such as this site. In the community forums people requested that I write a tutorial for it, and that has now gone up on the site.

It also works as a general introduction of using Wercker steps, so even if you're not interested in Hugo itself the tutorial might be useful for that purpose.
