> We’re now in the second half of 2022, which means that the new Melbourne Region for AWS can open up any day now, so it’s a good time to have a look at the implications for an APRA-regulated business. This post builds upon the excellent posts written by my colleagues about the new AWS Melbourne Region and moving to AWS as an APRA regulated business.

A different kind of article for me, less technical and instead focused on the opportunities provided by the upcoming region for strictly regulated businesses. It's available to read on the [CMD Solutions blog](https://www.cmdsolutions.com.au/why-the-aws-melbourne-region-is-a-good-thing-for-apra-regulated-businesses/).
