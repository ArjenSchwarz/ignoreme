> Many of us have probably built tools that allow someone to use their own SSH key to access a server; I know I have. Instance Connect is the AWS solution for this. It lets you upload a temporary key to an instance and then immediately connect to it. And for two of the options, you donâ€™t even need to use your own key.

This is my first post on the CMD blog and is the first in a series of three concerned with connecting safely to an EC2 instance. In this first post I dive into the new-ish EC2 Instance Connect.

CMD Solutions is the AWS focused brand within Mantel Group, which DigIO (my employer) is also a part of. Because of my status as AWS APN Ambassador, I represent CMD as well. Which also means that for some of my blogposts[^1], those focused on some small part of AWS for example, CMD is the better outlet. This is a good example of that.

[^1]: At least those that I write as a representive of my company. Obviously, the best place for anything I write is right here ;).
